# Commit convention

In order to provide the main intent of a certain commit, the following prefixes are used within the commit messages:

* `+` indicates a feature has been added.
* `-` indicates a feature has been removed.
* `r` indicates a refactoring.
* `f` indicates a fix.
* `d` indicates documentation has been added.
* `t` indicates addition of trace code, which is highly volatile since it may or may not work.

If a commit is a mix of the previous indicated situations, the main intent of the commit
will dictate which one of the previously listed prefixes is going to be used.
